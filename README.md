# Welcome to the GLaDOS terminal project!

This is a personal coding project of mine that aims to make a sort of functional terminal themed around the character "GLaDOS" from the portal games. 

It runs in batch (eventually I will port it too linux but I still need to learn dat)

There are three releases

The first one is the developer branch, containing unstable features from testing. 
The second one is the latest build, which is currently Version 1.1. 
And lastly, the old branches including older versions (Currently only including 1.0)

Have fun!
